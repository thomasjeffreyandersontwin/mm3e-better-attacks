This module improves on attacks made in the Mutants and Masterminds 3e System developed by @Zakarik.

Enhancements include:

- Auto Creation Of Attacks From Powers : takes powers from characters imported from hero lab,  the system provided jab's build importer, or any of the builds from the various jab's modules,  converts them into (automated) attacks on the character sheet. 

- Auto creation / sizing of templates and targeting of tokens when template is paced for area powers (Burst, Cone, Line), Just specify shape and size in the power associated with the attack (see above). This feature is in alpha and has a few known issues. The sizing and targeting is a bit off and will be optimized, also there is a dependency on warpgate, which is a retired module. Both issues are being addressed.
- For area effect powers make sure you have entered the appropriate area extra and size of the area for the power (eg Burst, Cone, Line 30 ft.)
